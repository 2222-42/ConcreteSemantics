representation and output. *)

(* 2.3.1 *)
(* It introduces the constructors C_{i} :: T_{i,1} => ... => T{i,n_{i}} => ( 'a_{1}, ..., 'a_{n})t
and expresses that any value of this type is built from these constructors in
a unique manner. *)
(*
niqueness is implied by the following properties of the
constructors:
- Distinctness
- Injectivity

(* 2.3.2 *)
(* Non-recursive functions can be defined. *)

(* Abbreviations are similar to definitions *)

abbreviation sq' :: "nat => nat" where
"sq' n \<equiv> n * n"
(* The key difference is that sq' is only syntactic sugar: after parsing, sq' t is
replaced by t * t; before printing, every occurrence of u * u is replaced by
sq' u. Internally, sq' does not exist. *)

(* definitions need to be expanded explicitly (Section 2.5.5)
whereas abbreviations are already expanded upon parsing *)

(* abbreviations should be introduced sparingly *)

(* 2.3.4 *)
(* Recursive functions are defined with fun by pattern matching over datatype constructors *)
(* all HOL functions must be total *)
(* Isabelleâ€™s automatic termination checker requires that the arguments of
recursive calls on the right-hand side must be strictly smaller than the arguments
on the left-hand side *)

(* The recursive function defined with fun does not define the function but also proves a customized indution rule.
This customized induction rule can simplify induction proofs.

(*
induction heuristic:
Let f be a recursive function. If the definition of f is more complicated
than having one equation for each constructor of some datatype, then
properties of f are best proved via f.induct.
